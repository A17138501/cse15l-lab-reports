I use ssh cs15lsp22akg@ieng6.ucsd.edu to log in and my terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basement. akg is my id here, after i reset my password before, and it is correct after i enter it so that it could make sure the account i use is mine.

Part 3 Trying Some Commands

I use command pwd to print current working directory, then i use ls to Print a List of Files and Subdirectories in the current directory, after that i tried cd perl5, cd is changing current working directory and the perl5 is the document im going to. i use mkdir to create a new directory called hello. i use cp command, to cope hello which i just created, however, it is not wotking.
