I use command pwd to print current working directory, then i use ls to Print a List of Files and Subdirectories in the current directory, after that i tried cd perl5, cd is changing current working directory and the perl5 is the document im going to. i use mkdir to create a new directory called hello. i use cp command, to cope hello which i just created, however, it is not wotking.
